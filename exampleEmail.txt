Dear students:

We were dismayed and disappointed as the submissions for the latest assignment came in. There are clear indications in some of the submissions that violations of academic integrity have taken place.

Before we start to contact individual students, we are giving you all a chance to contact us in the next 24 hours in the hopes that we can levy a penalty that will allow the students who committed a violation will still be able to finish the class with a reasonable grade.

If you have committed a violation of academic integrity, please send me an email as soon as possible to set up a meeting.

Professor _______
