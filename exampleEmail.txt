Hi everyone,

At 9:30 am this Saturday, May 13 in Wean 5310, we will be having a general design philosophy meeting with alumni.

Topics of discussion will include issues we encountered this year with build and maintenance, and high-level goals for next year. If you have anything specific you'd like to discuss, let me know so I can put together a more detailed agenda.

Please reply to let me know if you'll be attending so that we can arrange for lunch.

Also, if you're an alum and need someone to let you in the morning of the meeting (since doors require keycard access), feel free to call me at 123-456-7890.

Thanks!
